#Dark Forces
This is a Platform game based on simple 2d physics.
Very early stages of development this is more a pet project than anything else at the moment.

### To install:
First you will need python, git, and pip, then execute:
> git clone git@github.com/micahh2/Dark-Forces

> cd Dark-Forces

> pip install -r install.txt

### To run:
> python darkforces.py


***If it yells at you about not finding pygame***
Try:
> pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

For development and the like, it might be worthwhile to learn how to use [virtualenv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Python_VirtualEnv)
